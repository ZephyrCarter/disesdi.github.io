# ThinkPad Appreciation: Respect the Classic

*A classic machine that's still going strong*

This is a ThinkPad appreciation post.

Lenovo‚Äôs older gen ThinkPads [are legendary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad) machines.<sup>[1]</sup> You can find [used ones cheap](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2499337.m570.l1313&_nkw=Lenovo+ThinkPad+1st+Gen&_sacat=0), there are plenty of replacement parts, and that probably won‚Äôt matter because they can absolutely take a beating.

I have many memories of ThinkPads I used throughout the years (can one ever truly own a ThinkPad?), but this particular inspiration came from [a tweet](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1650213263932809219?s=20)<sup>[2]</sup>  by [@SwiftOnSecurity](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity):

*‚ÄùHere's my Windows Deployment Services imaging server at home. It's a Thinkpad X1 Gen1 with 8GB of RAM worth like $70‚Äù*

Obviously I had to [chime in](https://twitter.com/disesdi/status/1650477271831154690?s=20):

*This ThinkPad is a beast, it is a tank. Throw it in your bag, climb a fence, run. It‚Äôll be fine. Cracked case? Who cares. No heat sinks, no problem. Runs Linux like butter, any distro. Part broken? Grab a screwdriver and swap it out. Truly a beautiful machine.*

Some of my earliest forays into security played out on ThinkPads. The first times I ever sat staring at a dark terminal and its bright blinking cursor, telling myself *it‚Äôs ok to break things*, this was the machine. 

I broke a lot of things, but never the ThinkPad.

And when I decided to dive into machine learning, a ThinkPad is where I first opened a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org),<sup>[3]</sup> wrangled my first datasets, & trained my first models. It wasn‚Äôt fast, but it was reliable on a scale that‚Äôs difficult to describe.

The first time I ever took over an AI/ML system, it was on a ThinkPad. 

The ThinkPad was dependable. It spoiled me. I could count on it to be tough, to travel with me in my then highly mobile work, and still turn on every time. It got the job done; and if things went south, I could have a fresh [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org)<sup>[4]</sup> install in just about five minutes flat.

Ah, memories.  üé©
