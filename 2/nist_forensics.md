## Introduction


So you’re looking for resources in computer forensics. Maybe you’re starting out in the field, or maybe you’re just curious what’s out there. Maybe you’ve taken the first steps of searching, only to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information that can be difficult to sift through.


Whatever your reason, you might find yourself wondering: *where can I find trusted, well organized, industry-standard resources in digital forensics?*


In this post, I’ll give a brief intro to digital forensics, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the NICE framework for cybersecurity roles, and then tell you where you can find five excellent (and *free*) digital forensics resources on subjects from cloud computing, to biometrics research, to video, & more.


## What Is Digital Forensics?


First, let’s define *forensics* in the context of computer security. 


According to the [NIST Digital Evidence](https://www.nist.gov/digital-evidence) site, *”Digital forensics is the field of forensic science that is concerned with retrieving, storing and analyzing electronic data that can be useful in criminal investigations. This includes information from computers, hard drives, mobile phones and other data storage devices.”<sup>[1]</sup>*


## Why Use NIST Resources?


Why NIST? When it comes to cybersecurity standards and recommendations, The National Institute of Standards and Technology, or [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity),<sup>[2]</sup> is a great place to start looking.


NIST has a wealth of resources & recommendations for cybersecurity practitioners of all kinds. 


Side note: for more information on cybersecurity roles, check out the [NICE Framework](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/nice-framework), which gives a set of definitions for various cybersecurity roles arranged by categories, specialty areas, etc.<sup>[3]</sup>  


You can find a (more technical) guide to using the NICE Framework [here](https://niccs.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/using%20the%20nice%20framework_pdf.pdf?trackDocs=using%20the%20nice%20framework_pdf.pdf).<sup>[4]</sup> 


According to the [NIST cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/cybersecurity) site, *”NIST develops cybersecurity standards, guidelines, best practices, and other resources to meet the needs of U.S. industry, federal agencies and the broader public.”* 


NIST standards, recommendations, and best practices set industry standards and are considered a valuable resource by cybersecurity professionals.


NIST resources are broad. No one blog post could truly be an exhaustive catalog of what’s available, so you should definitely check out their cybersecurity resources yourself!


These resources are by no means exhaustive–there is a lot more to see on the NIST Digital Evidence site. 

According to the site, the projects we’re about to dive into *“are just a few examples of how [NIST helps] the digital forensics community to address these challenges.”


## The Resources: 5 Excellent & Free NIST Digital Forensics Sites To Check Out 


Here are five key NIST digital forensics resources for researchers at all levels of experience:


1. The [National Software Reference Library](http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/) is a "regularly updated archive of known, traceable software applications collected by NIST."

>*”We generate digital signatures from all files in that archive and release them in a quarterly Reference Data Set (RDS). When a law enforcement organization seizes a computer or mobile device as part of a criminal investigation, they can use the RDS to quickly identify the known files on that device. This reduces the effort required to determine which files are important as evidence and which are not.” – NIST* <sup>[5]</sup> 


2. The [Computer Forensic Tool Testing program](http://www.cftt.nist.gov/) ”establishes a methodology for testing computer forensic software tools by developing general tool specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test hardware.”

>*”There is a critical need in the law enforcement community to ensure the reliability of computer forensic tools….The [test] results help toolmakers to improve their products, allows users to make informed choices about which tools to use, and provides information to all interested parties on the capabilities of various computer tools used in forensic investigations.” – NIST* <sup>[6]</sup> 


3. Video forensics: NIST has "multiple projects aimed at advancing [video technologies](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/video-analytics) that have forensic applications.”* 

>*”Current project areas include detection of events in surveillance video, detection of events in internet video, and detection and understanding of images that have been altered from their original state.” – NIST* <sup>[7]</sup> 


4. Biometrics: NIST is ”working on multiple projects involving [image-based biometric recognition](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group) that have forensic applications” with “a particular focus on fingerprint, face, iris, and tattoo recognition.”  

> *”[NIST Biometric research] work is aimed at advancing measurement science, evaluation methodologies, best practices, image quality metrics, interoperability, and biometric standards.” – NIST* <sup>[8]</sup> 


5. The [NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Program](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/nist-cloud-computing-forensic-science) ”aims to improve the accuracy, reliability, scientific validity, and usefulness of cloud forensic science.”  

>*”In support of the [NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Program] project, NIST has established the Cloud Computing Forensic Science Public Working Group to perform research and identify gaps in technology, standards and measurements; to address various challenges in cloud forensics; and to develop a cloud forensics reference architecture. – NIST”*  <sup>[9]</sup>


## Conclusion


As you can see, NIST forensics resource areas range from cloud computing, to biometrics research,  to video technologies–even including forensic tool testing, and a National Software Reference Library–and much, much more.

Again, this list of NIST digital forensics is definitely not exhaustive. Hopefully this gives a good introduction to some of the resources that are available.
