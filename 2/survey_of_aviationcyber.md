# An (Informal) Survey Of The State Of Aviation Cybersecurity


### By <a href="https://disesdi.github.io/contact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disesdi</a> | *2022/12/02*

*We need to talk about AviationCyber, but where do we start?*

-------

Search for aviation cybersecurity and information is–as of right now, in 2022–not readily available in many traditional sources. There is content online about all kinds of security and cybersecurity topics, but aviation cybersecurity doesn’t seem to drum up a lot of interest. 


This trend belies the academic research to a certain extent, in that there are pages and pages of aviation cybersecurity-related papers with titles that seem alarming on the surface. Researching these can seem overwhelming. Titles such as *Cybersecurity – One of the Greatest Challenges for Civil Aviation in the 21st Century*,<sup>[1]</sup> and *Aviation Cybersecurity and Cyber-Resilience: Assessing Risk in Air Traffic Management*,<sup>[2]</sup> underscore the critical importance of aviation cybersecurity. Titles as innocuous-sounding as *A Framework for Aviation Cybersecurity*<sup>[3]</sup> might be viewed in the same session as highly technical–and somewhat scary sounding–titles such as *GDL90fuzz: Fuzzing - GDL-90 Data Interface Specification Within Aviation Software and Avionics Devices–A Cybersecurity Pentesting Perspective.*<sup>[4]</sup>


(Is it really possible to tamper with ADS-B by exploiting underlying Garmin Datalink technologies? Yes, but also: it’s *complicated*.)<sup>[4]</sup>


Meanwhile titles such as *Cybersecurity Of Aviation Sector Will Improve Slowly*,<sup>[5]</sup> while consistent with the pace of change in the industry, seem to be cause for concern when juxtaposed against the rapidly-evolving cybersecurity field. 


Perhaps more concerning are the issues raised in a 2016 paper entitled *On Perception and Reality in Wireless Air Traffic Communications Security*.<sup>[6]</sup> 


The paper points out that a lot of aviation technologies originate in the military. In military applications it’s possible to use strategies such as *security through obscurity*, and overwhelming technological superiority, to keep secrets secret. 


However, the requirements of a global civil aviation system are different. Civil aviation systems require cooperation–this means sharing of information & technologies as a means to keep all passengers safer. The nature of global travel and communications means it’s not practical or even beneficial to silo information–it benefits everyone to share. “Security through obscurity” isn’t possible in an information-sharing environment like civil aviation.


This approach has drawbacks, however, when it comes to cybersecurity. While the paper points out that aviation is one of the safest industries with a proven track record of continuous improvement, it also bears acknowledging that safety is not the same thing as security. 


“Security through obscurity” wasn’t the only security vector that should be considered compromised for civil aviation. The paper also discussed how the introduction of relatively cheap and sophisticated tools can allow bad actors a wide range of access to civil aviation navigation, communication, and other systems:


*“...with the widespread availability of cheap and powerful tools such as software-defined radios (SDR), the aviation community lost the considerable technical advantage protecting its communication in the past.”* <sup>[6]</sup>


How do we address the problem? 

One key takeaway from this paper: aviation and cybersecurity need a lot more cross-discipline collaboration. There is a lack of aviation knowledge in the cybersecurity community, and conversely a general lack of cybersecurity experience among aviation experts. 


This coupled with the expertise & experience-driven nature of aviation in general, means that aviation knowledge isn’t readily available to outsiders. 


It also means that cross-disciplinary information isn’t readily available to either of these two groups–aviation or cybersecurity–about one another. 


In short: Aviation needs more cyber, and cyber needs more aviators.


The saying goes that *aviation rules are written in blood.* Will changes in aviation cybersecurity come after a catastrophic security failure? 


We can do more than hope not–we can work across disciplines to improve aviation security and safety for all.
